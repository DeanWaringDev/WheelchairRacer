## Issue #1: Parkrun Page Crash ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Entire Parkrun page completely non-functional

### Problem
- React Hooks Error: "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render"
- Page showed error boundary instead of parkrun list
- Console showed multiple boundary errors and uncaught listener errors
- Component tree completely failed to render

### Root Cause
In `ParkrunBrowser.tsx`, the component violated the **Rules of Hooks** by having early return statements (`if (loading)` and `if (!data)`) BEFORE all hooks were called. 

React hooks must be called in the same order on every render. The original code structure was:
1. `useState` and `useEffect` hooks
2. `handleLoadMore` useCallback hook
3. ❌ **Early returns** (if loading/if !data)
4. `getScoreColor` useCallback hook
5. `formatMobilityName` useCallback hook
6. `filteredEvents` useMemo hook

When the component was in a loading state, it returned early, never calling the last three hooks. On subsequent renders, all hooks were called, causing React to throw the "Rendered more hooks" error.

### Solution
**File:** `frontend/src/components/ParkrunBrowser.tsx` (Lines 163-214)

Moved ALL hooks BEFORE any conditional returns:

```typescript
// ALL HOOKS FIRST
const handleLoadMore = useCallback(() => {
  setDisplayLimit(prev => prev + 50);
}, []);

const getScoreColor = useCallback((score: number): string => {
  if (score >= 80) return '#10b981';
  if (score >= 60) return '#f59e0b';
  if (score >= 40) return '#ef4444';
  return '#6b7280';
}, []);

const formatMobilityName = useCallback((key: string): string => {
  return key.split('_').map(word => 
    word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1)
  ).join(' ');
}, []);

const filteredEvents = useMemo(() => {
  if (!data || !data.events) return [];
  return data.events.filter(event => {
    if (mobilityFilter !== 'all' && event.accessibility?.analyzed) {
      const score = event.accessibility.scores[mobilityFilter as keyof AccessibilityScores];
      return score >= minScore;
    }
    return true;
  });
}, [data, mobilityFilter, minScore]);

// THEN CONDITIONAL RETURNS
if (loading) {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}

if (!data) {
  return <div>Error loading data</div>;
}
```

**Change:** Reordered code to ensure all hooks are called before any early returns, fixing the Rules of Hooks violation.

### Testing Required
- [ ] Navigate to /parkrun page
- [ ] Verify page loads without errors
- [ ] Confirm filter functionality works
- [ ] Check that all 600+ parkruns display
- [ ] Test search and category filters

## Issue #2: Forum Category Creation Blocked ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Admin cannot create or manage forum categories

### Problem
- Admin attempting to create category gets "403 Forbidden" error
- Error: "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'forum_categories'"
- RLS policy incorrectly blocking admin inserts
- Forum functionality partially broken

### Root Cause
RLS policies on `forum_categories` table were either missing or incorrectly configured, blocking legitimate admin operations.

### Solution
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251021120000_fix_forum_categories_rls.sql`

Created new migration with proper RLS policies:

1. **View Policy (SELECT)** - Anyone can view categories (no auth required)
2. **Insert Policy** - Admin only (`auth.uid() = '30b81e8f-3ba6-4c60-9f94-bcfe61ac81f9'`)
3. **Update Policy** - Admin only
4. **Delete Policy** - Admin only

```sql
-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view forum categories" ON forum_categories;
-- (drops all old policies)

-- Create new policies
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view forum categories" 
ON forum_categories FOR SELECT 
TO authenticated, anon 
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Admin can create forum categories" 
ON forum_categories FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated 
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = '30b81e8f-3ba6-4c60-9f94-bcfe61ac81f9');

-- (similar for UPDATE and DELETE)
```

### Deployment Steps
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/20251021120000_fix_forum_categories_rls.sql`
3. Run migration in SQL editor
4. Verify policies created successfully

### Testing Required
- [ ] Log in as admin
- [ ] Navigate to Forum page
- [ ] Click "Create New Category"
- [ ] Fill in form (name, description, icon, color)
- [ ] Submit - should succeed without 403 error
- [ ] Verify new category appears in list
- [ ] Test editing and deleting categories

---

## Issue #3: Category Modal Too Narrow ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Poor UX when creating forum categories

### Problem
- Category creation modal only 448px wide (max-w-md)
- Form fields cramped and difficult to use
- Color picker and icon input fields too narrow
- User reported "modal is too thin"

### Solution
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Forum.tsx` (Line 487)

```typescript
// BEFORE
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center bg-black bg-opacity-50 p-4">
  <div className="w-full max-w-md rounded-lg bg-white p-6 shadow-xl">

// AFTER
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center bg-black bg-opacity-50 p-4">
  <div className="w-full max-w-2xl rounded-lg bg-white p-6 shadow-xl">
```

**Change:** Increased modal width from `max-w-md` (448px) to `max-w-2xl` (672px)

### Testing Required
- [ ] Open Forum page
- [ ] Click "Create New Category"
- [ ] Verify modal is wider and more comfortable to use
- [ ] Check all form fields are easily accessible
- [ ] Test on mobile devices (should still be responsive)

## Issue #4: Blog Edit Functionality Missing ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Admin cannot fix typos or update blog posts

### Problem
- Blog posts could only be created or deleted
- No way to edit existing posts
- Admin forced to delete and recreate posts to fix mistakes
- Complete CRUD functionality not implemented

### Root Cause
Edit functionality was never implemented - only Create, Read, and Delete existed.

### Solution
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Blog.tsx`

**1. Added Edit State (Lines 78-83)**
```typescript
const [editingPostId, setEditingPostId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [editForm, setEditForm] = useState({
  title: "",
  content: "",
  category: "",
});
```

**2. Added Edit Handlers (Lines 278-324)**
```typescript
const handleStartEdit = (post: Post) => {
  if (user?.id !== ADMIN_USER_ID) return;
  setEditingPostId(post.id);
  setEditForm({
    title: post.title,
    content: post.content,
    category: post.category,
  });
  window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
};

const handleCancelEdit = () => {
  setEditingPostId(null);
  setEditForm({ title: '', content: '', category: '' });
};

const handleEditPost = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (user?.id !== ADMIN_USER_ID || !editingPostId) return;
  
  const cleanTitle = stripHTML(editForm.title);
  const cleanContent = sanitizeRichText(editForm.content);
  
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('posts')
    .update({
      title: cleanTitle,
      content: cleanContent,
      category: editForm.category,
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    })
    .eq('id', editingPostId);
  
  if (!error) {
    setEditingPostId(null);
    setEditForm({ title: '', content: '', category: '' });
    await fetchPosts();
  }
};
```

**3. Added Edit Button (Lines 633-643)**
```typescript
{user?.id === ADMIN_USER_ID && (
  <>
    <button
      onClick={() => handleStartEdit(post)}
      className="font-medium transition-colors"
      style={{ color: 'var(--color-primary)' }}
    >
      Edit
    </button>
    <button onClick={() => handleDeletePost(post.id)}>
      Delete
    </button>
  </>
)}
```

**4. Added Edit Form UI (Lines 473-554)**
- Complete edit form with title, content, category fields
- Cancel button to exit edit mode
- Pre-populated with existing post data
- Auto-scroll to form when editing starts
- Sanitization applied to prevent XSS

### Features Implemented
- ✅ Edit button appears next to Delete button (admin only)
- ✅ Click Edit populates form with post data
- ✅ Form appears at top of page
- ✅ Cancel button to exit edit mode
- ✅ Content sanitization for security
- ✅ Updated timestamp on save
- ✅ Auto-refresh posts list after update
- ✅ Smooth scroll to form

### Testing Required
- [ ] Log in as admin
- [ ] Navigate to Blog page
- [ ] Find any blog post
- [ ] Click "Edit" button
- [ ] Verify form appears at top with post data
- [ ] Modify title, content, or category
- [ ] Click "Update Post"
- [ ] Verify changes saved and displayed
- [ ] Test Cancel button functionality
- [ ] Verify only admin sees Edit buttons
