- Or text overlay on black screen: "WHICH PARKRUN IS ACCESSIBLE?"

**[5-15s] INTRODUCE**

- Show mouse hovering over search

**[15-25s] DEMONSTRATE**

- End with your face + smile

### Recording tips:

- Smile! Enthusiasm is contagious!

### Add captions:

## Option 4: Before/After Comparison

### Design layout:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BEFORE                    │    AFTER       │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────  │
│                            │                │
│  "Is this parkrun          │  ✅ Yes! 100/100│
│   wheelchair accessible?"  │                │
│                            │  ⚠️  No: 16/100 │
│  ❓ Who knows?             │                │
│                            │  ✨ Mostly: 80  │
│  😕 Just turn up and hope  │                │
│                            │  📊 See ALL     │
│                            │     2,747!      │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────  │
│                                             │
│       wheelchairracer.com                   │
│       Know before you go!                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**In Canva:**
1. Create 2 columns
2. Left = grey/dull colors + question marks
3. Right = bright/vibrant colors + checkmarks
4. Add dividing line between them

## Option 5: User Testimonial Style (for Week 2)

Once you get feedback, create:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                              │
│  💬 "Just checked Northampton - spot on!    │
│      Perfect for my racing chair!"          │
│      - Sarah, wheelchair racer              │
│                                              │
│  💬 "Finally know which parkruns I can      │
│      do with my walking frame!"             │
│      - John, Kettering                      │
│                                              │
│  ───────────────────────────────────────    │
│                                              │
│  YOUR feedback helps others find            │
│  accessible parkruns!                        │
│                                              │
│  wheelchairracer.com                         │
│                                              │

## Absolute Minimum (If Short on Time)

### Text-Only Post with Emoji Graphics:

```
🏃‍♂️♿ PARKRUN ACCESSIBILITY GUIDE 🏃‍♂️♿

✅ All 2,747 UK parkruns scored
✅ 8 different mobility types  
✅ GPS + elevation + surface data
✅ Real user feedback

📊 EXAMPLES:
▪️ Northampton: 100/100 (perfect!)
▪️ Market Harborough: 80-95/100 (excellent)

🔍 Find YOUR parkrun:
👉 wheelchairracer.com

💬 Share your experience to help others!

#parkrun #accessibility #wheelchair
```

**This works!** But adding an image increases engagement by 2-3x.

## Stock Images (If Needed)

**Free wheelchair/accessibility images:**
- unsplash.com (search: wheelchair, accessibility, parkrun, running)
- pexels.com (search: adaptive sports, wheelchair racing)
- pixabay.com (search: wheelchair, accessibility)

**Make sure:**
- ✅ Commercial use allowed
- ✅ Shows active wheelchair users (not medical/hospital vibes)
- ✅ Diverse representation
- ✅ Positive/empowering imagery

---

## My Recommendation for Week 1

**GO SIMPLE:**

1. **Main post:** Text post with emojis (no image) OR simple Canva graphic
2. **Pinned comment:** Add image/video in comments if you want
3. **Focus energy on:** Responding to comments quickly

**Why?** 
- Creating perfect visuals takes time
- Engagement (comments/shares) matters more than pretty graphics
- You can always add visuals in Week 2

**Week 2+:**
- Once you have feedback, create testimonial graphics
- Show "before/after" scores after user input
- Film quick video testimonial with someone who found value

## Final Recommendation

**For LAUNCH (Week 1):**
Use the text post I created (Option 1+3 mix) with simple emoji formatting. It's authentic, personal, and quick to deploy.

**Add later (Week 2):**
- Video showing the site in action
- Testimonial graphics from user feedback
- Before/after score comparisons

**Remember:** 
Better to post NOW with simple formatting than wait for perfect visuals. The parkrun community responds to authenticity and helpfulness, not fancy graphics!

You've got this! 🚀
