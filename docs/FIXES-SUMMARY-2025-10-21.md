## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Parkrun Page Crash
**Problem:** React error "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render"  
**Root Cause:** React hooks being called after conditional returns, violating Rules of Hooks  
**Fix:** Moved all `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks before any early returns  
**File:** `frontend/src/components/ParkrunBrowser.tsx`

### 2. ‚úÖ Forum Category Creation Blocked
**Problem:** 403 Forbidden - "new row violates row-level security policy"  
**Root Cause:** RLS policies using incorrect admin UUID (`30b81e8f...` instead of `7cd64da3...`)  
**Fix:** Created proper RLS policies with correct admin UUID  
**Migration:** `supabase/migrations/20251021120003_fix_forum_categories_correct_admin.sql`

### 3. ‚úÖ Blog Post Editing Failed
**Problem:** 400 Bad Request - "Could not find 'updated_at' column"  
**Root Cause:** Trying to update non-existent `updated_at` column in posts table  
**Fix:** Removed `updated_at` from update query, added proper error handling  
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Blog.tsx`

### 4. ‚úÖ Category Modal Too Narrow
**Problem:** Modal only 448px wide, cramped form fields  
**Fix:** Increased modal width from `max-w-md` to `max-w-2xl` (672px)  
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Forum.tsx`

### 5. ‚úÖ BONUS: Parkrun Detail Pages Not Loading
**Problem:** "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module" errors  
**Root Cause:** Missing `.htaccess` file for Apache to handle React Router  
**Fix:** Moved `.htaccess` to `frontend/public/` for automatic inclusion in builds  
**Files:** `frontend/public/.htaccess`, updated `DEPLOY.md`

## Lessons Learned

1. **React Hooks Rules:** Always call hooks in the same order every render
2. **Admin UUIDs:** Verify actual user IDs before hardcoding in RLS policies
3. **Database Schema:** Check column existence before using in queries
4. **Apache Routing:** `.htaccess` is essential for SPAs on Apache servers
5. **Testing Importance:** Comprehensive production testing catches critical issues
