# Forum Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you set up the complete Forum system with categories, topics, replies, and sample data.

## Step 1: Run the SQL Migration

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your Supabase project
   - Navigate to the SQL Editor

2. **Execute the Forum Schema**
   - Open the file: `supabase-migrations/forum-schema.sql`
   - Copy all contents
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute

This will create:
- âœ… `forum_categories` table
- âœ… `forum_topics` table  
- âœ… `forum_replies` table
- âœ… RLS policies (admin for categories, authenticated users for topics/replies)
- âœ… Triggers for auto-updating reply counts and last activity
- âœ… Indexes for performance
- âœ… 4 default categories with icons and colors
- âœ… 8 sample topics (2 per category)
- âœ… Sample replies for each topic
- âœ… `increment_topic_views()` function for tracking views

## Step 2: Verify Installation

After running the SQL:

1. **Check Tables**
   - Go to Table Editor in Supabase
   - You should see 3 new tables:
     - `forum_categories` (4 rows)
     - `forum_topics` (8 rows)
     - `forum_replies` (several rows)

2. **Check RLS Policies**
   - Go to Authentication > Policies
   - Verify policies exist for all 3 forum tables

## Step 3: Test the Forum

1. **Visit Forum Page**
   - Navigate to `/forum` on your website
   - You should see:
     - Real-time stats (members, posts, active topics, online)
     - 4 category cards (General Discussion, Training & Technique, Equipment & Gear, Events & Races)
     - Recent topics list with 8 sample topics

2. **Test Creating a Topic**
   - Sign in to your account
   - Click "New Topic" button
   - Select a category
   - Fill in title and content
   - Submit

3. **Test Viewing a Topic**
   - Click on any topic from the list
   - You should see:
     - Topic details (title, author, views, replies)
     - All replies
     - Reply form (if signed in)

4. **Test Replying**
   - Sign in (if not already)
   - View a topic
   - Type a reply in the form at the bottom
   - Submit
   - Reply should appear immediately

1. **Add New Categories**
   - Click "+ Add Category" button on forum page

## Troubleshooting

### Topics not showing?
- Check that `is_active = true` on categories
- Verify RLS policies are enabled
- Check browser console for errors

### Can't create topics?
- Make sure you're signed in
- Verify your user has a username set
- Check RLS policy: "Authenticated users can create topics"

### Stats showing zero?
- Run SQL again to ensure triggers are created
- Check that sample data was inserted
- Verify no errors in Supabase logs

### Can't delete as admin?
- Verify your user ID matches: `5bc2da58-8e69-4779-ba02-52e6182b9668`
- Check RLS policy includes your admin UUID
- Test by viewing topic as admin (should see admin buttons)

## Next Steps
