# Facebook Post - Wheelchair Racer Accessibility Project

## RECOMMENDED POST (Mix of Personal Story + Success Story)

🏃‍♂️♿ **Fellow parkrunners - I've built something special and I need your help to make it amazing!**

I'm Dean, a wheelchair racer who loves parkrun. You know that question that comes up all the time: *"Is [insert parkrun name] wheelchair accessible?"* 

The answer is always "...maybe? It depends?" Right? 😕

**Well, not anymore!**

I've spent months building an accessibility scoring system for EVERY UK parkrun (all 2,747 of them!) that gives specific scores for 8 different mobility types:
- Racing chairs, day chairs, off-road/sports chairs
- Handbikes, frame runners/RaceRunners
- Walking frames, crutches, walking sticks

The site analyzes GPS routes, elevation data, surface types, and course descriptions to give each parkrun an accessibility score from 0-100.

**And here's the exciting part - it's already working!**

✅ Northampton scoring 100/100 for all mobility types (perfectly flat and smooth!)
✅ Market Harborough excellent overall (80-95 across the board)
✅ Rutland Water great for off-road chairs (100) but trickier for walking frames due to narrow paths

**But the BEST part?** The system learns from YOUR experiences!

When someone told me "Corby has a really steep hill", the system:
1. Added that keyword to the course
2. Automatically recalculated the scores
3. Dropped them from way too high to much more realistic
4. Now helps the next person make an informed choice

**This is where YOU come in:**

The system is good, but it needs YOUR real-world experience to become great! Whether you use mobility aids yourself, volunteer with parkrunners who do, or just want to help make parkrun more accessible - your input is invaluable!

**Can you spare 2 minutes to:**
✅ Visit the site and search for your home parkrun
✅ Check if the accessibility score matches your experience  
✅ Share any specific features I might have missed (gates, obstacles, surface changes, etc.)

Every piece of feedback makes the scores more accurate for the next person who needs them. Together we're building the ultimate parkrun accessibility guide! 💪

## Alternative Post (Option 2 - Direct & Action-Focused)

♿ **Calling all parkrunners with mobility challenges!**

Quick question: Before you tried your first parkrun, did you know if the course would work for your wheelchair/walking frame/crutches?

Probably not, right? 😕

I'm building a solution - an accessibility scoring system for every UK parkrun that tells you BEFORE you go whether a course is suitable for:
- Wheelchairs (racing, day, or off-road)
- Handbikes
- Frame runners
- Walking frames, crutches, or sticks

**The scores are based on:**
🗺️ GPS route analysis (tight turns, narrow paths)
⛰️ Elevation data (steep hills that might be barriers)
🌳 Surface types (tarmac, grass, gravel, trail)
📝 Course descriptions (gates, obstacles, terrain)

**I need YOUR experience to make it accurate!**

The system works, but real runners know things the data can't tell me. For example:
- "There's a kissing gate at 2km that's impossible for wheelchairs"
- "The 'gravel' section is actually perfectly smooth"  
- "That steep hill looks bad on paper but it's totally doable"

**Takes 2 minutes:**
1. Visit **[YOUR WEBSITE URL]**
2. Check your home parkrun's score
3. Tell me if it's accurate (there's a feedback form)

Your input literally makes the scores better for the next person! 🙌

## Alternative Post (Option 3 - Community Success Story)

🎉 **GREAT NEWS for parkrun accessibility!**

You know how sometimes someone asks "Is [parkrun name] wheelchair accessible?" and the answer is always "...maybe? It depends?"

Well, not anymore! 

I've spent the last few months building an accessibility database for EVERY UK parkrun (2,747 courses!) that scores them across 8 different mobility types.

**The best part?** The system learns from YOUR experiences!

When someone tells me "Corby has a really steep hill at the start", the system:
1. Adds that keyword to the course
2. Automatically recalculates the score
3. Helps the next person make an informed choice

**Already seeing results:**
✅ Northampton scoring 100/100 for all mobility types (perfectly flat and smooth!)
✅ Rutland Water great for off-road chairs (100) but challenging for walking frames due to narrow paths
✅ Market Harborough excellent overall (80+) with just some tight turns

**Your turn!**

Check out your local parkrun and let me know:
- Does the score match your experience?
- Any hidden obstacles I've missed?
- Any great features that make it more accessible than the data suggests?

Together we can build the ultimate parkrun accessibility guide! 💪
