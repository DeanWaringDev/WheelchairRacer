# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE RESOLVED

## Problem
The Parkrun detail pages were failing with "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module" errors in production. Users could browse parkruns but clicking "View Full Details" resulted in errors.

## Root Cause
The `.htaccess` file was **NOT** being uploaded to one.com with the `dist/` folder. Without this file, Apache doesn't know how to handle React Router's client-side routing, causing:

1. Direct navigation to `/parkrun/bushy-park` ‚Üí 404 error
2. Browser tries to load TypeScript source files instead of compiled JS
3. Dynamic route imports fail
4. React Router navigation breaks

## Solution
‚úÖ **`.htaccess` is now in `frontend/public/.htaccess`**

Vite automatically copies everything in the `public/` folder to `dist/` during build, so the `.htaccess` file will ALWAYS be included.

## What the .htaccess Does
```apache
# React SPA Routing
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

This tells Apache: "If the requested URL isn't a real file or directory, serve `index.html` instead and let React Router handle the route."

## Verification Checklist
Before uploading to one.com:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build

# Verify .htaccess exists in dist
ls -la dist/.htaccess
```

You should see:
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 4119 Oct 21 12:09 dist/.htaccess
```

If missing, something is wrong with the build process.

## Upload Instructions
1. Build: `cd frontend && npm run build`
2. Upload **ALL** contents of `frontend/dist/` to one.com root directory
3. Verify `.htaccess` was uploaded (check via FTP/File Manager)
4. Test by visiting direct URL like `https://yoursite.com/parkrun/bushy-park`

## Why This Is Critical
Without `.htaccess`:
- ‚ùå Direct links to pages will 404
- ‚ùå Browser refresh on any route except `/` will fail
- ‚ùå Shared links won't work
- ‚ùå Lazy-loaded routes may fail to load
- ‚ùå Google/social media crawlers can't index pages

With `.htaccess`:
- ‚úÖ All routes work as expected
- ‚úÖ Users can refresh any page
- ‚úÖ Direct links work
- ‚úÖ SEO works properly
- ‚úÖ React Router functions correctly

## Status
üü¢ **RESOLVED** - `.htaccess` now automatically included in every build via `frontend/public/` folder.

## History
- **Issue Found:** October 21, 2025 - Parkrun detail pages failing in production
- **Root Cause:** Missing `.htaccess` file in deployment
- **Resolution:** Moved `.htaccess` to `frontend/public/` for automatic inclusion
- **Files Modified:** 
  - Created `frontend/public/.htaccess`
  - Updated `DEPLOY.md` with verification steps
  - Updated `docs/PRODUCTION-FIXES.md` with warning

## Future Builds
No action needed - `.htaccess` is now part of the build pipeline and will automatically be included in `dist/` folder.
