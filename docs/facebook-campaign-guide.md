# Facebook Campaign - Complete Guide

## 📸 Visual Assets You Need

### 1. Main Post Image (ESSENTIAL)
Create a simple, eye-catching graphic with:

**Option A - Before/After Style:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  BEFORE:                            │
│  "Is this parkrun wheelchair        │
│   accessible?"                      │
│  ❓ Maybe? Who knows?               │
│                                     │
│  AFTER:                             │
│  ✅ Northampton: 100/100            │
│  ⚠️  Kettering: 16/100              │
│  ✨ Market Harborough: 80/100       │
│                                     │
│  wheelchairracer.com                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Option B - Screenshot Style:**
- Screenshot of your website showing a parkrun with scores
- Highlight the 8 mobility types
- Show the map view if you have it
- Circle/highlight the accessibility score prominently

**Option C - Infographic Style:**
```
     2,747 UK PARKRUNS SCORED!
     
     ♿ 8 Mobility Types
     🗺️  GPS Route Analysis  
     ⛰️  Elevation Data
     🌳 Surface Types
     
     Find YOUR accessible parkrun
     wheelchairracer.com
```

**Tools to create it:**
- Canva (free, templates available)
- Crello/VistaCreate (free)
- Adobe Express (free)
- Even PowerPoint works!

**Specifications:**
- Size: 1200 x 630 pixels (Facebook optimal)
- Use high contrast colors
- Include your website URL
- Add wheelchair icon/emoji for recognition

---

### 2. Video Option (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - 10x more engagement!)

Create a 30-60 second screen recording showing:

**Script:**
```
[0-5s]  "Looking for a wheelchair-accessible parkrun?"
[5-15s] [Show website homepage] "I've scored all 2,747 UK parkruns"
[15-25s] [Search for a parkrun] "Just search for your local course"
[25-40s] [Show scores] "See accessibility scores for 8 mobility types"
[40-50s] [Show feedback form] "Share your experience to help others"
[50-60s] "Visit wheelchairracer.com - Let's make parkrun accessible for everyone!"
```

**Tools:**
- OBS Studio (free screen recorder)
- Loom (free, easy to use)
- Windows Game Bar (Win+G - built-in!)
- Your phone camera recording your laptop screen (works surprisingly well!)

**Tips:**
- Add captions (80% of Facebook videos watched without sound!)
- Keep it under 60 seconds
- Use upbeat background music (Facebook has free music library)
- Show your face briefly at start/end for personal connection

## 🎯 Boosted Post Strategy

### Budget Recommendation
- **Starter:** £20-30 for 7 days
- **Better:** £50-75 for 7 days  
- **Ideal:** £100-150 for 14 days

Expected reach: £1 = 500-1000 people (depends on targeting)

### Primary Targeting
```
Location: United Kingdom
Age: 25-65
Interests:
  - parkrun
  - Running
  - Wheelchair sports
  - Disability sports
  - Adaptive sports
  - Accessibility
  
Behaviors:
  - Engaged shoppers (shows they take action online)
  - Technology early adopters
  
Connections:
  - Friends of people who like parkrun pages
```

### Lookalike Audience (Advanced)
If you have emails of people who've used the site:
1. Upload them to Facebook
2. Create "Lookalike Audience" (Facebook finds similar people)
3. Target 1-2% similarity in UK

### Interest Stacking (Target people interested in ALL of these)
- parkrun + disability awareness
- parkrun + wheelchair sports
- running + accessibility

---

## 📅 Posting Strategy

### Best Times to Post
1. **Saturday 9:00-10:00 AM** (post-parkrun, people checking Facebook)
2. **Saturday 7:00-8:00 PM** (evening relaxation time)
3. **Wednesday 6:00-8:00 PM** (mid-week engagement)

**Recommendation:** Post organically Saturday 9 AM, then boost it immediately

### First 2 Hours Are Critical
Facebook's algorithm decides if your post is "good" in the first 1-2 hours.

**Your job:**
- ✅ Respond to EVERY comment within 5 minutes
- ✅ Like every comment
- ✅ Ask follow-up questions to generate more comments
- ✅ Get 3-5 friends to comment/share immediately (boosts algorithm)
- ✅ Share to your personal profile
- ✅ Share to relevant parkrun groups (ask admin first!)

## 💬 Response Templates

### Positive Feedback
**Comment:** "This is brilliant! Just checked my parkrun!"

**Your Response:** "[Name] that's amazing! Does the score match your experience? If you notice anything specific that would help the next person, hit the feedback button on the site - every bit helps! 🙌"

---

### Correction/Disagreement  
**Comment:** "Hmm, says my parkrun is 80/100 but I think it's more like 50/100 because of the gravel section"

**Your Response:** "This is EXACTLY the feedback I need! 🎯 Please use the feedback form on the site to mention the gravel - the system will learn from your experience and update the score. That's how we make it accurate! Thank you! 💪"

---

### Questions About Specific Parkruns
**Comment:** "What does Bushy Park score?"

**Your Response:** "Great question! Just search 'Bushy Park' on wheelchairracer.com and you'll see scores for all 8 mobility types. Let me know what you think! If you've done it yourself, your feedback would be gold! ⭐"

---

### People Wanting to Help
**Comment:** "How else can I help?"

**Your Response:** "You're amazing! The most valuable thing is feedback on ANY parkrun you've experienced. Even quick notes like 'spot on' or 'seems high/low' help train the system. Every parkrun you've tried with mobility aids is valuable data that helps others! 🙏"

---

### Negative/Skeptical Comments
**Comment:** "How can an algorithm know better than actual experience?"

**Your Response:** "You're absolutely right - it can't! That's why the system learns from real parkrunners. The scores are based on data (GPS, elevation, descriptions) BUT they improve every time someone shares their actual experience. It's human experience + data working together! Want to help make it better? 😊"

---

### Shares/Tags
**Comment:** "@friend you should check this out!"

**Your Response:** "Thanks for spreading the word [Name]! @friend if you check out your local parkrun, I'd love to know if the score seems right! 🏃‍♂️"
