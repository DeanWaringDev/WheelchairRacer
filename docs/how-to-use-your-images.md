## 🎨 Create a Carousel Post (Advanced)

Facebook allows multiple images in one post. This is POWERFUL:

**Slide 1:** searchScreen.jpg
Text overlay: "Step 1: Search your parkrun"

**Slide 2:** marketHarborough.jpg  
Text overlay: "Step 2: See accessibility scores"

**Slide 3:** feedbackForm.jpg
Text overlay: "Step 3: Share your experience"

**Caption:**
```
3 steps to help make parkrun accessible for everyone! 👆

Swipe to see how it works →

All 2,747 UK parkruns scored for 8 mobility types.
Your feedback makes it better! 

wheelchairracer.com

#parkrun #accessibility #wheelchair
```

**How to create carousel:**
1. Upload all 3 images when creating post
2. Facebook automatically creates carousel
3. People swipe through like Stories

**Engagement:** Carousels get 10x more engagement than single images!

---

## 💡 Alternative: Create Collage

Combine all 3 into one image:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. SEARCH        2. CHECK SCORE        │
│  [searchScreen]   [marketHarborough]    │
│                                         │
│  3. SHARE FEEDBACK                      │
│  [feedbackForm]                         │
│                                         │
│  wheelchairracer.com                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Tools:**
- Canva: Upload images → Create collage
- Photopea.com: Free online Photoshop
- PowerPoint: Insert images → Export as image

## 🎯 Smart Usage for Comments

When people comment:

**Q: "How does it work?"**
👉 Reply with searchScreen.jpg
"Just search for any parkrun and you'll see scores like this! [image]"

**Q: "What's a good score?"**
👉 Reply with marketHarborough.jpg
"Market Harborough is a great example - 80-95 across all types! [image]"

**Q: "How can I help?"**
👉 Reply with feedbackForm.jpg
"Just takes 30 seconds to share your experience! [image]"

## 📊 A/B Testing Strategy

Try both approaches and see what works better:

### Test A: Single image main post
- Post with searchScreen.jpg
- Track engagement (likes, comments, shares)

### Test B: Carousel post
- Post with all 3 images
- Track engagement

### Test C: Video
- Screen recording showing all 3 steps
- Track engagement

**Winner:** Use the format with highest engagement/reach for Week 2+

---

## 🔥 Boosted Post Image Strategy

For your £20-50 boosted post:

**Option 1:** searchScreen.jpg
- **Pro:** Shows exactly what they'll see (reduces bounce rate)
- **Pro:** Clean, professional
- **Con:** Might not grab attention in feed

**Option 2:** All 3 as carousel
- **Pro:** More engaging, tells complete story
- **Pro:** Higher click-through rate
- **Con:** More complex for mobile users

**My recommendation:** Start with **searchScreen.jpg** for simplicity, then test carousel in Week 2.

---

## 📱 Mobile Optimization Check

Make sure images look good on mobile (80% of Facebook users):

1. Open each image on your phone
2. Check text is readable
3. Check it's not too "busy"
4. Make sure key info visible even when cropped

**Facebook crops images:** Top and bottom might be cut off in feed, full image shows when clicked.

**Safe zone:** Keep important text/elements in center of image.

---

## ✨ Add Text Overlays (Optional)

Make images more shareable:

### searchScreen.jpg + overlay:
```
"All 2,747 UK parkruns scored!"
wheelchairracer.com
```

### marketHarborough.jpg + overlay:
```
"✅ Excellent accessibility
80-95/100 across all types"
```

### feedbackForm.jpg + overlay:
```
"Your feedback helps others
Takes 30 seconds!"
```

**How:** Canva → Upload image → Add text box → Position → Download

---

## 🎬 Bonus: Create Short Videos

Use your images as video slides:

**30-second video script:**
- [0-10s] searchScreen.jpg - "Search any UK parkrun"
- [10-20s] marketHarborough.jpg - "See accessibility scores"  
- [20-30s] feedbackForm.jpg - "Share your experience"

**Tools:**
- Canva Video (free)
- Windows Photos app (built-in)
- iMovie (Mac/iPhone)
- InShot (phone app)

**Add:**
- Transitions between images (fade/slide)
- Upbeat background music
- Text captions
- Your voiceover explaining each step

## 💎 Premium Tip: User-Generated Content

After you get feedback, ask permission to screenshot:

"Thanks for your feedback on Northampton! 
Mind if I share your comment in a post? 
It really helps show others the system works!"
```

Then create:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [User's comment screenshot]            │
│  "Northampton score is spot on!"        │
│  - Real parkrunner                      │
│                                         │
│  Check YOUR parkrun:                    │
│  wheelchairracer.com                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
