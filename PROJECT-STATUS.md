# 🚀 Project Status - October 17, 2025

## ✅ Completed Today

### 1. Data Scraping & Cleaning
- ✅ Scraped 2,743/2,747 parkruns (99.85% success rate)
- ✅ Extracted course descriptions (84% size reduction, 22M → 3.5M chars)
- ✅ Cleaned boilerplate text from descriptions
- ✅ 2,622 parkruns with clean descriptions ready for analysis

### 2. Keywords System v3.1
- ✅ 175 keywords across 12 categories
- ✅ 8 mobility types with impact scoring (-50 to +50)
- ✅ Refined based on real wheelchair user feedback:
  - Removed false positives ("track", generic "hill", "gates")
  - Added context-specific keywords ("steep hill", "through gates")
  - Added positive keywords ("gentle slope" for wheelchair workout)
- ✅ Validated with Finsbury parkrun: 0/100 → 85/100 ✨

### 3. Accessibility Analysis
- ✅ 9,203 keyword matches across all parkruns
- ✅ Scores calculated for all 8 mobility types
- ✅ Distribution analysis showing excellent/good/moderate/challenging/very_challenging
- ✅ Top 5 and bottom 5 courses identified per mobility type

### 4. Workspace Cleanup
- ✅ Root: 12 markdown files → 1 (README.md)
- ✅ Data: 24 files → 13 production files
- ✅ Docs: 11 files → 2 active docs
- ✅ All old files archived (not deleted)
- ✅ Python cache removed

## 📊 Key Results

### Score Distribution (Racing Chair Example):
- **Excellent (80-100):** 781 parkruns
- **Good (60-79):** 269 parkruns
- **Moderate (40-59):** 684 parkruns
- **Challenging (20-39):** 285 parkruns
- **Very Challenging (0-19):** 603 parkruns

### Top Accessible Parkruns (100/100):
- Hackney Marshes parkrun (multiple mobility types)
- Richmond parkrun (multiple mobility types)
- Pollok parkrun, Glasgow (multiple mobility types)
- Hull parkrun (multiple mobility types)

### System Validation:
- ✅ Finsbury (tarmac) correctly scores 85/100 (was wrongly 0/100)
- ✅ Bushy (grass + hoggin + tree roots) correctly scores 0-50 depending on mobility type
- ✅ Walking frames have highest barrier rate (1,002 very challenging courses)
- ✅ Off-road chairs most forgiving (only 116 very challenging courses)

## 🎯 Next Steps (When You Return)

### Immediate (Oct 18-24):
1. **Database Schema Design**
   - Design Supabase tables for parkruns + accessibility scores
   - Include: uid, name, slug, country, coordinates, description, postcode
   - Include: 8 mobility type scores, keyword matches, categories
   - Add indexes for filtering (country, mobility_type, score range)

2. **Load Data into Supabase**
   - Create migration scripts
   - Load 2,622 parkruns with scores
   - Test queries for performance

3. **Start UI Development**
   - List view with accessibility scores
   - Color-coded scores (green/yellow/orange/red/black)
   - Filter by mobility type, score range, country
   - Search by name

### Medium Priority (Oct 25-31):
4. **Interactive Map**
   - Mapbox or Leaflet integration
   - Markers colored by accessibility score
   - Hover popups with scores
   - Click to detail page

5. **Detail Pages**
   - Show course description
   - Display all 8 mobility type scores
   - Show matched keywords (transparency)
   - Getting there info (postcode, directions)

6. **Launch Prep**
   - Test with real wheelchair users
   - Fix any scoring issues found
   - Deploy to production
   - **Oct 31 deadline: Parkrun page live (FREE forever)**

### Future (Nov-Dec):
7. Route Analysis Feature (Premium)
8. Workout Plan Generator (Premium)

## 💡 Key Insights from Today

1. **Lived Experience is Critical:** Your feedback as a wheelchair user fixed major false positives (Finsbury 0→85)
2. **Context Matters:** "Past the athletics track" ≠ "running on a muddy track"
3. **Hills Can Be Good:** Generic hill penalties removed, only penalize steep/challenging hills
4. **Rolling Past ≠ Through:** Gates you pass are fine, gates you navigate through are barriers
5. **System Works:** 96% of parkruns analyzed successfully, scores feel accurate
