Uses impact scoring from -50 to +50, where each mobility type starts at 50/100 (neutral) and keywords add/subtract points to reach a final score out of 100. v3.2: Added racing chair maneuverability challenges (narrow paths + tight corners = -40), increased wide path bonus for racing chairs (+10 to +20), added racing-friendly features (long straights, gentle corners).",
