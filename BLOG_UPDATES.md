## Database Migration Required

**IMPORTANT:** Run the SQL migration before using these features!

File: `supabase-migrations/blog-likes-comments.sql`

This migration creates:
1. `likes_count` column on `posts` table
2. `post_likes` table for tracking likes
3. `comments` table for storing comments
4. Row Level Security (RLS) policies for both tables
5. Database triggers for auto-updating like counts
6. Indexes for performance optimization

**How to Run:**
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of `supabase-migrations/blog-likes-comments.sql`
4. Paste and run the SQL
5. Verify tables and policies were created
