# Parkrun Detail Page - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete and Ready for Testing

## What Was Built

Enhanced the parkrun page to show detailed accessibility information for each parkrun event, replacing the basic card view with a comprehensive detail page.

## New Features

### 1. **Parkrun Detail Page** (`/parkrun/:slug`)
A dedicated page for each parkrun showing:

#### Left Column (Main Content):
- **Route Map Section**
  - Interactive OpenStreetMap iframe with actual parkrun coordinates
  - Centered on the parkrun location with 2km x 2km view
  - Zoom controls and interactive panning
  
- **Course Description Section**
  - Full extracted course description from official parkrun page
  - Clean, readable format without boilerplate content
  
- **Official Course Page Link**
  - Blue call-to-action button
  - Links to official parkrun.org.uk course page
  - Opens in new tab

#### Right Column (Accessibility Scores):
- **All 8 Mobility Type Scores**
  - Racing Chair
  - Day Chair
  - Off-Road Chair
  - Handbike
  - Frame Runner
  - Walking Frame
  - Crutches
  - Walking Stick

- **Visual Score Representation**
  - Score out of 100 for each mobility type
  - Color-coded progress bars:
    - üü¢ Green (80-100): Excellent
    - üü° Yellow (60-79): Good
    - üü† Orange (40-59): Moderate
    - üî¥ Red (20-39): Challenging
    - ‚ö´ Gray (0-19): Very Challenging
  - Category labels (Excellent, Good, etc.)
  
- **Score Guide Legend**
  - Clear explanation of what each score range means
  
- **Disclaimer**
  - Notes that scores are auto-generated from descriptions
  - Encourages users to verify with official course page

### 2. **Updated Parkrun Browser** (`/parkrun`)
- Changed "View ‚Üí" external links to "View Details ‚Üí" internal links
- Now routes to `/parkrun/:slug` instead of external parkrun.org.uk
- Maintains all existing filters and search functionality

### 3. **Header Enhancement**
- Shows parkrun name, location, country, and postcode
- Clean hierarchical display of information
- Back button to return to parkrun list

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **Created:** `frontend/src/pages/ParkrunDetail.tsx`
   - Full parkrun detail page component
   - Loads and merges data from two sources:
     - `parkrun_accessibility_scores.json` (scores, descriptions)
     - `bronze_data.json` (coordinates, location)
   - Responsive layout (2-column on desktop, stacked on mobile)
   - Loading states and error handling

2. **Modified:** `frontend/src/App.tsx`
   - Added route: `/parkrun/:slug` ‚Üí `<ParkrunDetail />`
   - Imported ParkrunDetail component

3. **Modified:** `frontend/src/components/ParkrunBrowser.tsx`
   - Changed external link to internal routing
   - Updated link text: "View ‚Üí" ‚Üí "View Details ‚Üí"
   - Added Link component from react-router-dom

4. **Added:** `frontend/public/data/parkrun_accessibility_scores.json`
   - Copied from data directory (559,413 lines)
   - Contains all 2,622 analyzed parkruns with accessibility scores

## Data Flow

```
User clicks "View Details" in Parkrun Browser
    ‚Üì
Router navigates to /parkrun/:slug
    ‚Üì
ParkrunDetail component loads
    ‚Üì
Parallel data fetch:
  1. parkrun_accessibility_scores.json (scores, description)
  2. bronze_data.json (coordinates, location, country)
    ‚Üì
Data merged by matching slug
    ‚Üì
Page renders with:
  - Map (using coordinates from bronze data)
  - Description (from accessibility scores)
  - Scores (from accessibility scores)
  - Location info (merged from both sources)
```

## Example URLs

- List view: `http://localhost:5174/parkrun`
- Bushy parkrun: `http://localhost:5174/parkrun/bushy`
- Market Harborough: `http://localhost:5174/parkrun/market-harborough`
- Finsbury: `http://localhost:5174/parkrun/finsbury`

## Score Color System

The color-coded system makes it immediately clear which parkruns are suitable:

| Score Range | Color | Category | Meaning |
|-------------|-------|----------|---------|
| 80-100 | Green | Excellent | Highly accessible, minimal barriers |
| 60-79 | Yellow | Good | Generally accessible, minor challenges |
| 40-59 | Orange | Moderate | Some accessibility challenges |
| 20-39 | Red | Challenging | Significant accessibility barriers |
| 0-19 | Gray | Very Challenging | Major accessibility barriers |

## Map Integration

**OpenStreetMap Embed:**
- Free, no API key required
- Interactive (zoom, pan)
- Shows actual parkrun location
- 2km x 2km bounding box centered on coordinates
- Marker placed at exact parkrun location

**Example Map URL:**
```
https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?
  bbox=-0.350791,51.395992,-0.320791,51.425992
  &layer=mapnik
  &marker=51.410992,-0.335791
```

## Mobile Responsiveness

- **Desktop (lg+):** 2-column layout (8/4 split)
  - Left: Map + Description + Link
  - Right: Scores (sticky sidebar)
  
- **Mobile:** Stacked layout
  - Header
  - Map (full width)
  - Description
  - Scores (full width)
  - Link button

## Keywords v3.2 Integration

The detail page displays scores calculated by:
- 199 keywords across 13 categories
- 8 mobility types with differentiated impacts
- Racing chair maneuverability considerations
- Context-specific keyword matching

**Transparency:** Users can see:
- Final score (0-100)
- Category (Excellent ‚Üí Very Challenging)
- Number of keyword matches used in calculation
- Visual comparison across all mobility types

## Testing Checklist

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Browser**
   - Visit http://localhost:5174/parkrun
   - Click "View Details" on any parkrun
   - Verify all sections render correctly
   - Test on mobile (responsive design)

2. **Real-World Testing**
   - After Market Harborough parkrun today
   - Compare actual experience vs displayed scores
   - Gather feedback on score accuracy
   - Note any missing information

3. **Future Enhancements** (Optional)
   - Add keyword breakdown expansion (show which keywords matched)
   - Add photos from parkrun.org.uk
   - Add recent results/finisher counts
   - Add community ratings/reviews
   - Add "Report an Issue" button
   - Add social sharing buttons

## File Sizes

- `parkrun_accessibility_scores.json`: 25.7 MB
- Contains 2,622 analyzed parkruns
- Each event has ~9.7 KB of data on average
- Loads in ~1-2 seconds on broadband

## Performance Notes

- Data loads once per page navigation
- No unnecessary re-fetches
- OpenStreetMap embed is lightweight
- Could add lazy loading for map iframe (future optimization)
- Could implement browser caching (future optimization)
