## Keyword Categories

### Surface Types

#### Smooth Surfaces (★★★★★ for ALL)
**Keywords**: tarmac, asphalt, paved, concrete, smooth path, sealed surface

**Why it matters**:
- Racing chairs: Maximum speed, no resistance
- Frame runners: Perfect foot traction, stable push-off
- Walking frames: Wheels roll smoothly, no catching
- Crutches/sticks: Tips stable, no slipping

#### Packed Surfaces (★★★★ most types)
**Keywords**: hard packed, hoggin, compacted gravel, crushed stone, firmly packed

**Suitability**:
- Racing chairs: ★★★★ (Slight slowdown)
- Frame runners: ★★★★ (Good if truly firm)
- Walking frames: ★★★ (Small wheels may struggle)
- Crutches: ★★★★ (Good if packed hard)

**Key consideration**: "Hard packed" can vary greatly - firm enough for crutch tips?

#### Loose Surfaces (★ to ★★★)
**Keywords**: gravel, loose gravel, shingle, loose stone, unmade path

**Suitability**:
- Racing chairs: ★ (Nearly impossible)
- Frame runners: ★ (Feet slip, no push-off power)
- Walking frames: ★ (Wheels sink, extremely difficult)
- Crutches: ★★ (Tips sink, energy-draining)

**Critical for**: Frame runners absolutely need stable surface for foot grip.

#### Grass Surfaces (★ to ★★★★)
**Keywords**: grass, lawn, meadow, field, turf

**Condition-dependent**:
- **Dry, short grass**:
  - Racing chairs: ★★ (Possible but slow)
  - Frame runners: ★★★ (Manageable with good shoes)
  - Walking frames: ★★ (Very difficult)
  - Crutches: ★★★ (Tips stable if firm underneath)

- **Wet/long grass**:
  - Racing chairs: ★ (Extremely difficult)
  - Frame runners: ★ (Feet slip)
  - Walking frames: ★ (Impossible)
  - Crutches: ★★ (Tips sink)

### Terrain Features

#### Hills & Elevation (Major Challenge for All)
**Keywords**: hill, steep, incline, gradient, undulating, climb

**Impact by Type**:
- **Racing/day chairs**: Upper body power needed, braking on descents
- **Frame runners**: Leg power needed for uphill, control issues downhill
- **Walking frames**: EXTREMELY difficult uphill (fatigue), dangerous downhill (loss of control)
- **Crutches**: Upper body fatigue, balance issues on slopes
- **Walking sticks**: Manageable gentle slopes, difficult steep

**Walking frame specific**: "Undulating" may be impossible - even gentle slopes drain energy fast.

#### Flat Terrain (★★★★★ Benefit for Walking Aids)
**Keywords**: flat, level, even, pancake flat

**Why it's critical**:
- Frame runners: Efficient propulsion, consistent pace
- Walking frames: Stability, reduced fatigue, can complete distance
- All users: Predictable, energy conservation

### Obstacles

#### Physical Barriers (CRITICAL RED FLAGS)
**Keywords**: steps, stairs, gates, kissing gate, stile, turnstile, narrow section

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Steps**: 
  - All wheeled aids: IMPOSSIBLE without help
  - Crutches: Difficult but possible
  - Walking stick: Manageable with care

- **Gates/Kissing Gates**:
  - Handbikes/frame runners: Very difficult (wide footprint)
  - Walking frames: May not fit through
  - Others: Manageable but slow

- **Narrow Sections**:
  - Walking frames: May need to turn sideways
  - Frame runners: Wide turning circle problematic
  - Others: Manageable

#### Surface Hazards (Trip/Fall Risk)
**Keywords**: roots, tree roots, rocks, uneven, rough, potholes, cracks, cobbles

**Risk by Type**:
- **Racing chairs**: Low clearance, wheels catch
- **Frame runners**: Front wheel catches, potential crash
- **Walking frames**: Wheels catch, user falls
- **Crutches/sticks**: Tips catch in cracks, MAJOR FALL RISK

**Walking aid priority**: Trip hazards are more dangerous than for wheeled users - falls can cause serious injury.

### Weather Conditions

#### Wet Conditions (CRITICAL IMPACT)
**Keywords**: mud, muddy, puddles, wet, slippery when wet, waterlogged

**Why it's critical**:
- **Frame runners**: Complete loss of foot traction, cannot propel
- **Walking frames**: Wheels stuck, user exhausted
- **Crutches/sticks**: MAJOR SLIP RISK - falls likely
- **Racing chairs**: Nearly immobile

**Safety note**: Wet conditions transform "manageable" courses into dangerous ones for walking aids.

### Distance & Pace Considerations

#### Distance Impact (5K Endurance)
**Considerations**:
- **Frame runners**: 5K requires significant leg strength/stamina (15-30 mins)
- **Walking frames**: 5K is LONG (45-90+ mins, high fatigue)
- **Crutches**: Upper body fatigue builds (30-50 mins)
- **Walking stick**: Generally manageable (25-45 mins)

**Walking frame specific**: May need 90+ minutes. Are volunteers prepared to stay that long? Is there a time limit?

#### Pace Indicators (★★★★★ for Slower Users)
**Keywords**: "walkers welcome", "no time limit", "tail walker", "at your own pace"

**Why it matters**:
- Walking frames: Confirmation that slower paces are genuinely welcomed
- Frame runners: Varies widely by ability, good to know all paces accepted
- All slower users: Reduces anxiety about "holding others up"

## Scoring Methodology

### Base Score Calculation
1. **Start with surface type score** (1-5)
2. **Apply terrain modifiers** (+/- points)
3. **Check for critical barriers** (may override score)
4. **Consider weather conditions** (conditional notes)
5. **Factor in distance/pace** (especially for walking frames)

### Special Considerations

#### Frame Runners - Critical Factors:
1. **Surface stability** (most important)
2. **Path width** (turning circle)
3. **Foot traction conditions** (wet = no-go)
4. **Hill severity** (leg power limits)

#### Walking Frames - Critical Factors:
1. **Surface smoothness** (any unevenness problematic)
2. **Flat terrain** (hills may be impossible)
3. **Distance/time** (fatigue is major issue)
4. **No steps** (absolutely cannot navigate)

#### Crutches - Critical Factors:
1. **Trip hazards** (fall risk)
2. **Surface grip** (wet/ice dangerous)
3. **Upper body fatigue** (distance consideration)
4. **Gaps/cracks** (tips get stuck)

## Example Analyses

### Example 1: "Ideal Accessible Course"
**Description**: "Flat, tarmac path through park. Wide, smooth surface. Suitable for all abilities."

**Analysis**:
- Racing chair: 5/5 (Excellent - perfect conditions)
- Day chair: 5/5 (Excellent)
- Frame runner: 5/5 (Excellent - stable, flat, smooth)
- Walking frame: 5/5 (Excellent - smooth, flat, no obstacles)
- Crutches: 5/5 (Excellent - stable surface)
- Walking stick: 5/5 (Excellent)

**Why it works**: Smooth surface, flat, wide paths = accessible for everyone.

### Example 2: "Challenging Trail Course"
**Description**: "Undulating woodland track with exposed tree roots. Grass and earth paths. May be muddy after rain."

**Analysis**:
- Racing chair: 1/5 (Unsuitable - roots, grass, mud, hills)
- Frame runner: 1/5 (Unsuitable - unstable surface, no foot traction on wet)
- Walking frame: 1/5 (Unsuitable - uneven, roots = trip hazard, hills impossible)
- Crutches: 2/5 (Difficult - doable dry but high fall risk on roots/mud)
- Walking stick: 2/5 (Difficult - manageable for some but risky)

**Why it doesn't work**: Multiple barriers for frame runners (unstable surface) and walking frames (uneven + hills). High fall risk for ambulatory aid users.

### Example 3: "Mixed Urban Course"
**Description**: "Two laps of park paths. Mainly tarmac with short grass section. Some gentle slopes. One narrow footbridge."

**Analysis**:
- Racing chair: 4/5 (Good - mostly smooth, gentle slopes manageable)
- Frame runner: 4/5 (Good - mostly stable, can handle grass if dry)
- Walking frame: 3/5 (Moderate - slopes challenging, bridge may be narrow, grass section difficult)
- Crutches: 4/5 (Good - mostly manageable)
- Walking stick: 4/5 (Good)

**Considerations**: 
- Multi-lap = can assess after lap 1
- Narrow bridge may require walking frame to slow/turn sideways
- Grass section condition-dependent

```

## Future Enhancements

1. **User-Submitted Reports**: Real experiences from actual users of each mobility type
2. **Photo Analysis**: ML detection of surface types, obstacles, width
3. **Weather Integration**: Real-time impact on scores (e.g., rain = lower frame runner score)
4. **Community Ratings**: User votes for accuracy
5. **Route Alternatives**: Suggest modified routes avoiding barriers
6. **Time Estimates**: More accurate predictions per mobility type
7. **Accessibility Badges**: "Frame Runner Friendly", "Walker Accessible", etc.

## Contributing New Keywords

When adding keywords:
1. Consider impact on ALL 8 mobility types
2. Provide clear notes explaining why it matters
3. Think about both physical barriers and safety
4. Consider fatigue/endurance factors
5. Test against real course descriptions

## Inclusive Design Principles

This system follows these principles:
- **Nothing About Us Without Us**: Based on real user experiences
- **Assume Ability**: Focus on what each user CAN do on each course
- **Safety First**: Highlight fall risks, dangerous conditions
- **Dignity**: Slower paces are valid and welcomed
- **Choice**: Provide info so users can decide for themselves
