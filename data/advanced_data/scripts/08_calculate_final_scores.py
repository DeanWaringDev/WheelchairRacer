08_calculate_final_scores.py - Calculate Final Weighted Accessibility Scores

This script combines all scoring sources (keywords, maneuverability, elevation, user feedback)
using mobility-specific weighting to produce final accessibility scores for each parkrun.

The weighting system is tuned based on ground-truth validation from real wheelchair users
and recognizes that different mobility types prioritize different factors:
- Racing chairs: Heavily affected by path width and turns (high maneuverability weight)
- Walking aids: Heavily affected by gradual hills (high elevation weight)
- Off-road chairs: Better at handling terrain (lower penalty weights)

Input Files:
    - data/04_gold_parkrun_keywords_score.json (keyword-based scoring)
    - data/05_gold_parkrun_map_analysis_score.json (turn/width analysis)
    - data/06_gold_parkrun_elevation_score.json (gradient analysis)
    - data/07_gold_parkrun_user_submitted_scores.json (community feedback)

Output:
    - data/08_gold_parkrun_final_scores.json (final weighted scores)

# MOBILITY-SPECIFIC WEIGHTING
# ============================================================

# Weights tuned based on ground-truth validation from real users
# Each mobility type has different priorities:
#
# Racing Chair: VERY sensitive to path width and tight turns (high maneuverability)
#               Elevation critical (risk of tipping backwards on steep hills)
#               Keywords catch major obstacles
#
# Day Chair: Moderate sensitivity to turns, sensitive to elevation
#            Elevation = accessibility barrier (can't climb steep hills, tipping risk)
#            Keywords important for terrain type
#
# Off-Road Chair: Better at handling terrain than day chair
#                 More tolerant of rough surfaces
#                 Still affected by major obstacles
#
# Walking Aids: Hills are HARDER but NOT accessibility barriers (can still complete)
#               More affected by surface quality, obstacles, narrow paths
#               Elevation weight reduced - difficulty â‰  inaccessibility
#
# USER FEEDBACK: Most valuable resource - increased weights significantly
#                Will readjust if trolls submit unrealistic scores
