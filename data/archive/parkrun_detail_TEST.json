This score allows you to compare your personal performance against other people's performances even though they might be a different age and a different sex to you - the higher the score the better the performance. The scores can also be compared across different race distances - to allow you to, for example, compare a 5km time against a marathon.\n\nSupport\n\nCourse Map\n\nCourse Description\n\nFacilities\n\nToilets located at play area, a 1 minute jog from start (open before start of run).\n\nGetting There\n\nLocation of start\n\nGetting there by public transport\n\nGetting there on foot\n\nGetting there by road\n\nIf arriving by car please park in either Hampton Court Station car park (KT8 9AE) or Hampton Court Green car and coach park (KT8 9BP).

After 250 metres or so on grass, running parallel with the play park, the course moves onto a hoggin path towards the Church Grove gate. There is a left turn to take you around the edge of Hampton Wick Cricket Club. Continue towards the Hampton Wick gate and take a left turn into Cobbler’s Walk (also called Nightingale Lane). After passing The Leg-of-Mutton Pond there is a right turn onto a track towards the Sandy Lane gate. On reaching the gate, there is a left turn to take you along the perimeter (hoggin) path towards the Teddington Gate. A further left turn will take you onto the grass of Chestnut Avenue. There is another left turn back onto Cobbler’s Walk. A marshal will indicate the point at which you will make a right turn onto a track to run towards Heron Pond, over a little bridge - be careful of the tree roots in the 100m section approaching the bridge - round the South side of the pond on a hoggin path or grass (your choice) - the finish is in sight!\n\nOccasionally, the start will revert to the Diana Fountain end of Chestnut Avenue. This may be as a result of other events in the park or dangerous conditions.\n\nThe start is on grass, close to the Eastern side of the Diana Fountain roundabout in the continuation of Lime Avenue. This is 1.5 km (South) from the Teddington Gate entrance to Bushy Park and close to the Hampton Court Gate entrance.\n\nThe nearest railways stations at Hampton Court, Teddington or Hampton Wick.  Each of these is less than 2km from the start.  Buses do not go through the park but there are many local routes that travel close to the park, between Twickenham/Teddington and Kingston and also Kingston and Hampton Court.\n\nThe park is easily accessible by both foot and cycle. Cycle parking is available in both the Diana Fountain car park, close to the children's playground and also at The Pheasantry Cafe.\n\nextra clearing <br> - only *really* needed in news page, and not even\n\tthere in practice as one of two columns (news and rhs sidebar) should stretch\n\tthe page to fill the whole viewport height (which was the issue) - but works\n\tnicely on all pages - clears the bird on footer image fromt the text nicely",

There are uneven sections on the paths and stone flags so we ask you take care and watch your footfall during the event\n\nAfter the start, head to the roundabout on the diagonal path which bisects the park, heading anti-clockwise and exiting on the fourth path. At the end of this path, take a sharp right past the Queen Victoria statue (stone flag section) and head clockwise around the park with a nice downhill towards the Robert Peel statue (some uneven sections). There take a sharp right uphill, then the first left to take you to the start, continuing to the Queen Victoria statue and another lap. On the third lap, bear right past the start line to reach the finish.\n\nFor parkrun tourists who need a post-parkrun-spruce-up, Leeds University will allow us to use the shower facilities at their nearby ‘Gryphon Sports Centre’ (on Woodsley Road) for £1 per runner.

For reference, a nearby post code is LS6 1AN, however, please note that this is not a good final destination to head for by car as there is no parking in the immediate area of the start.\n\nLeeds has a large and well connected railway station which can bring you to Leeds city centre. You can walk from the railway station to the Woodhouse Moor parkrun start line in about half an hour. Alternatively, there are several buses which run from the city centre and go past Woodhouse Moor (along Woodhouse Lane).\n\nAssuming you are starting from Leeds railway station, exit the station on New Station Street and cross Boar Lane to join Albion Street. Carry on straight ahead up Albion Street, crossing the Headrow, when the road becomes Woodhouse Lane, keep going up Woodhouse Lane. After about 2km of walking from the railway station you will arrive at the junction of Woodhouse Lane and Clarendon Road. Turn left onto Clarendon Road. After a little bit less than 400m you will arrive at the junction of Clarendon Road and Moorland Road. You’ll see the Duke of Wellington statue, head down the path that bisects the park to a small roundabout, the start is on the right.\n\nLeeds has good motorway links from all directions via the M62 and M1 but allow sufficient time for the final part of the journey into the city. It’s generally possible to find free, on-street parking on the streets surrounding the park, allow around 10 minutes walking time if using the public car parking available at the University of Leeds.\n\nextra clearing <br> - only *really* needed in news page, and not even\n\tthere in practice as one of two columns (news and rhs sidebar) should stretch\n\tthe page to fill the whole viewport height (which was the issue) - but works\n\tnicely on all pages - clears the bird on footer image fromt the text nicely",

The route consists of 3 laps - 2 long laps that wind through the park and a shorter lap plus a start and finish straight.\n\nFrom the lodge entrance run up the wide road through the trees towards the Hall. Go through the white gate turning right and run up towards the hall. Opposite the hall entrance turn left, keeping to the tarmac path. Go carefully around the low stone plinth, over the haha bridge and out onto the \"Archery Field\". Run straight across the field keeping to the worn central path. Join the gravel path turning left as you leave the field. At the path junction turn sharp right and follow the narrow tarmac path down the hill to Duck Poo Corner. Take care on this section as the path and corners are slippery especially when wet. Allow other participants plenty of room there will be space to overtake later on.\n\nAt Duck Poo Corner turn left (if you are in the lead, beware of the Canada Geese - they are part of the fun and may move if you clap or shout) for a short distance then cross the river over the metal bridge. Bear left up the hill on a wider stony path. At the top turn right onto a long straight path that undulates pleasantly through the woods. As you leave the woods the path descends sharply (and you can see the start area across the river ahead). Turn right and follow the path back towards the centre of the park through trees.\n\nCross over the long wooden bridge turning left down the ramp. This bridge is very slippery when wet, slow down take care when turning at the end. Keep straight on over the stone bridge, and then fork right and run up the stony path towards the big oak tree. At the top of this path turn right to start your second lap.\n\nLap 2 is now the same as lap 1.\n\nReaching the top of the stony path for the second time again turn right to start the short lap 3 which is the same as laps one and two until Duck Poo Corner where the route now turns right to run alongside the large pond. At the end of the pond bear right, cross the same stone bridge as laps one and 2 then fork right up the stony path again.  At the top turn left to rejoin the main path with about 200m to the finish.\n\nA simple reminder is that to complete the course you need to go up the hill to the white gate 3 times and through the woods twice.\n\nPlease keep to the left wherever possible and allow overtaking on the right.\n\nParts of the course may still be unsuitable for single buggies. Please contact the team in advance to discuss this further.\n\nThe start area is on the park road next to the lodge by the pedestrian gate near the Bridge Lane roundabout.\n\nBramhall (1 km) and Cheadle Hulme (2km) railway stations are within jogging distance. Both have services from Manchester and Stockport (www.nationalrail.co.uk). There are bus stops (services 307, 308, 377, 378) by the roundabout adjacent to the race start (www.gmpte.com).\n\nThe start area is on the park road next to the lodge by the pedestrian gate near the Bridge Lane roundabout. From the car park go towards the hall then turn right down the park road past the white iron gate and continue down the hill directly to the start area.\n\nIf you are lost don’t panic it is a small park. First find the hall. Then look down at the ponds and find the river. The start area is down on the far right by the road, where the river flows into the park.\n\nBramall Hall is situated in Bramhall near Stockport (postcode SK7 3NX). From the south take the A34 then A555 to Bramhall then go through Bramhall towards Stockport on the A5102 (Bramhall Lane South). From Stockport take the A6 then A5102 (Bramhall Lane) through Davenport.

There is one small lap of the football pitches followed by two large laps of the park. There are marshals at key points.\n\nThe course starts on the grass in the northwest corner of the football pitch area of the War Memorial Park. It starts with one full clockwise lap of the two football pitches. Then along the northern edge again to the next corner before leaving the football pitch area by veering off to the left and then a sharp left hairpin on the short hill. Then the course goes between the trees and turns right onto the tarmac path going round the lamppost. Before you get to the subway steps turn right, cutting the corner, and head down the hill on the tarmac path through the trees. Go straight on at the bottom and then up the hill with the tennis courts on your right, this is affectionately known as Tennis Court Hill (TCH) and is renowned as a PB breaker. Once at the top, go briefly off the tarmac path to cut the corner and re-join the path going to the left of both play areas. Follow the path clockwise right round the edge of the park, past the bandstand, the aviary and the gate by the council offices. Follow the path round to the right and then straight on through the trees. As you emerge from the trees follow the path straight on, past the small car park on the left and round to the right of the Totally Tennis building. After you have passed the building, turn left onto the grass by the first tree on the right. Follow the markers around the football pitch area and then continue to do another large lap of the park.\nAt the end of this second large lap as you turn onto the grass football pitch area head straight for the middle to finish.\n\nThe postcode of the War Memorial Park is RG21 4AG.\n\nBasingstoke parkrun starts in the northwest corner of the football pitch area of the War\nMemorial Park in Basingstoke.
