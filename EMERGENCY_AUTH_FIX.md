# 🚨 EMERGENCY AUTH FIX - DO THIS NOW

## Current Situation:
- ✅ User exists: contact@deanwaring.co.uk 
- ❌ NO profile for that user
- ❌ Sign in fails: "Invalid login credentials"
- ❌ Sign up fails: "Database error"

## Root Cause:

## 🔥 IMMEDIATE FIX (Do in Order):

### 1. Run EMERGENCY_FIX.sql (5 minutes)

4. Paste and click **RUN**

**What it does:**
- ✅ Creates profile for your existing user IMMEDIATELY
- ✅ Sets up trigger for future users
- ✅ Fixes RLS policies
- ✅ Verifies everything works

---

### 2. Disable Email Confirmation (2 minutes)

**Why:** Your user might not have confirmed their email yet.

**Steps:**
1. Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
2. Scroll to "Email Auth"
3. Find: **"Enable email confirmations"**
4. **UNCHECK IT** ☐ (turn OFF)
5. Click **Save**

---

### 3. Check Email Confirmation Status (1 minute)

**Steps:**
1. Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Look at your user: contact@deanwaring.co.uk
3. Check "Email Confirmed" column
4. If it says "Not Confirmed":
   - Click on the user
   - Click "Confirm Email" button
   - Or delete user and re-register

---

### 4. Test Sign In (2 minutes)

1. **Clear browser cookies/cache** (CTRL+SHIFT+DEL)

3. Try signing in with: contact@deanwaring.co.uk
4. Use your password

3. Click "Create Account"

**Expected:**

- ✅ Can sign in immediately

---

## ⚠️ If EMERGENCY_FIX.sql Doesn't Work:

Try the simpler version:

**File:** `supabase/migrations/SIMPLE_FIX.sql`

1. Run it the same way
2. It's more basic but should work

---

## 🔍 After Running Fix, Verify:

Run diagnostic again to confirm:

```sql
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth.users) as users,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.profiles) as profiles;
```

**Should show:**
- users: 1 (or more)
- profiles: 1 (or more)
- **Numbers should MATCH!**

---

- [ ] Run EMERGENCY_FIX.sql in Supabase
- [ ] Disable email confirmation in settings
- [ ] Check if user email is confirmed

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

### Common Issues:

**Issue 2: "User is already registered"**
- Delete the user from Auth → Users
- Run EMERGENCY_FIX.sql again
- Register fresh

**Issue 3: "Profile already exists"**
- That's good! Just clear cookies and try signing in

**Issue 4: Still getting 400/500 errors**

- Look for specific error message
- Share the error with me
