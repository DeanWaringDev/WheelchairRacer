# üîß SUPABASE SQL MIGRATIONS - RUN THESE NOW

## Overview
Both the **Forum Categories** and **Blog Post Updates** are failing due to missing/incorrect RLS (Row Level Security) policies in Supabase. You need to run 2 SQL migrations to fix both issues.

---

## üö® MIGRATION 1: Fix Forum Categories

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251021120000_fix_forum_categories_rls.sql`

**Fixes:** "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'forum_categories'"

**What it does:**
- Drops old/conflicting RLS policies
- Creates proper admin-only policies for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
- Allows everyone to view categories (SELECT)

---

## üö® MIGRATION 2: Fix Blog Post Updates

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251021120001_fix_posts_rls.sql`

**Fixes:** "400 Bad Request" when updating blog posts

**What it does:**
- Drops old/conflicting RLS policies
- Allows everyone to read posts
- Allows users to update/delete their own posts
- Allows admin to update/delete ANY post
- Allows authenticated users to create posts

## üìã HOW TO RUN THESE MIGRATIONS

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click on your **Wheelchair Racer** project
3. In the left sidebar, click **SQL Editor**

### Step 2: Run Migration 1 (Forum Categories)
1. In SQL Editor, click **New Query**
2. Open the file: `supabase/migrations/20251021120000_fix_forum_categories_rls.sql`
3. **Copy ALL contents** of the file (lines 1-58)
4. **Paste** into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)
6. Wait for success message
7. Scroll down to see verification results (should show 4 policies)

### Step 3: Run Migration 2 (Blog Posts)
1. In SQL Editor, click **New Query** (for a fresh query)
2. Open the file: `supabase/migrations/20251021120001_fix_posts_rls.sql`
3. **Copy ALL contents** of the file (lines 1-57)
4. **Paste** into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)
6. Wait for success message
7. Scroll down to see verification results (should show 4 policies)

### Step 4: Verify Success
Both queries should show a table at the bottom with the policies created:

**For forum_categories:**
- Anyone can view forum categories (SELECT)
- Admin can create forum categories (INSERT)
- Admin can update forum categories (UPDATE)
- Admin can delete forum categories (DELETE)

**For posts:**
- Anyone can view posts (SELECT)
- Authenticated users can create posts (INSERT)
- Users can update own posts or admin can update any (UPDATE)
- Users can delete own posts or admin can delete any (DELETE)

## üß™ TESTING AFTER MIGRATIONS

### Test 1: Create Forum Category
1. Go to Forum page
2. Click "Create New Category"
3. Fill in:
   - Name: "Test Category"
   - Description: "Testing RLS fix"
   - Icon: "üß™"
   - Color: Any
4. Click "Create Category"
5. ‚úÖ Should succeed without errors

### Test 2: Edit Blog Post
1. Go to Blog page
2. Find any blog post (as admin)
3. Click "Edit" button
4. Change the title or content
5. Click "Update Post"
6. ‚úÖ Should succeed without errors
7. ‚úÖ Post should update and show changes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### Admin User ID
These policies use your admin UUID: `30b81e8f-3ba6-4c60-9f94-bcfe61ac81f9`

This gives you (and only you) full admin access to:
- Create/update/delete forum categories
- Update/delete ANY blog post (even if you didn't create it)

### Security
- Everyone can read posts and categories (public access)
- Only authenticated users can create posts
- Only admin can manage categories
- Users can edit their own posts, admin can edit all posts

### If Migrations Fail
If you get errors like "policy already exists", the policies might already be in place. Check existing policies:

```sql
-- Check forum_categories policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'forum_categories';

-- Check posts policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'posts';
```

If policies exist but are incorrect, the `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` commands at the top of each migration should handle it.

5. ‚úÖ Console shows no RLS errors

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. **Refresh the page** (F5)
3. **Test forum category creation**
4. **Test blog post editing**
5. Upload the new `dist/` folder with all fixes to one.com
