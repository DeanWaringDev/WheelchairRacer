## 🔍 Debugging: Check Supabase Logs

If STILL not working:

1. **Supabase Dashboard → Logs → Auth Logs**
2. Look for your sign-in attempt
3. Click on the failed request
4. Look for error message

**Common errors:**

| Error | Meaning | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| "Email not confirmed" | Email verification required | Run NUCLEAR_FIX.sql |
| "Invalid login credentials" | Wrong password | Reset password |
| "User not found" | User doesn't exist | Re-register |
| "Too many requests" | Rate limited | Wait 5 minutes |

## 🆘 Alternative: Create Fresh User

If your existing user is corrupted:

### **Delete Old User:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
DELETE FROM public.profiles WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'contact@deanwaring.co.uk');
DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'contact@deanwaring.co.uk';
```

### **Register New User:**
1. Go to sign-up page
2. Use: `test@example.com` / `test123456`
3. Should work immediately (with NUCLEAR_FIX.sql run)

---

## ✅ After It Works:

Once you can sign in:

1. **Re-enable email confirmation:**
   - Supabase → Authentication → Settings
   - Check "Enable email confirmations"
   - For production security

2. **Tighten RLS policies:**
   - Run a proper RLS policy script
   - Currently super permissive for testing

3. **Change test passwords:**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable 2FA if available

---

## 📞 Still Stuck?

Try this in order:

1. ✅ Run NUCLEAR_FIX.sql
2. ✅ Disable email confirmation
3. ✅ Clear browser cookies
4. ✅ Delete user and re-register
5. ✅ Check Supabase logs for specific error
6. ✅ Try different email/password

If NOTHING works, the issue might be:
